From now on, everything is generic and directly applies to most datasets. We assume that all feature engineering is done at this stage and focus on model tuning. For multi-class problems, you can use h2o.logloss() or h2o.confusionMatrix() instead of h2o.auc() and for regression problems, you can use h2o.deviance() or h2o.mse().

#Split the data for Machine Learning

We split the data into three pieces: 60% for training, 20% for validation, 20% for final testing.
Here, we use random splitting, but this assumes i.i.d. data. If this is not the case (e.g., when events span across multiple rows or data has a time structure), you’ll have to sample your data non-randomly.
```{r}
splits <- h2o.splitFrame(
  data = df,
  ratios = c(0.6,0.2),   ## only need to specify 2 fractions, the 3rd is implied
  destination_frames = c("train.hex", "valid.hex", "test.hex"), seed = 1234
)
train <- splits[[1]]
valid <- splits[[2]]
test  <- splits[[3]]
prop.table(table(as.data.frame(train$survived)))
prop.table(table(as.data.frame(valid$survived)))
prop.table(table(as.data.frame(test$survived)))
```


# Establish baseline performance
As the first step, we’ll build some default models to see what accuracy we can expect. Let’s use the AUC metric for this demo, but you can use h2o.logloss and stopping_metric="logloss" as well. It ranges from 0.5 for random models to 1 for perfect models.
The first model is a default GBM, trained on the 60% training split
```{r}
## We only provide the required parameters, everything else is default
gbm <- h2o.gbm(x = predictors, y = response, training_frame = train)
## Show a detailed model summary
gbm
```
```{r}
## Get the AUC on the validation set
h2o.auc(h2o.performance(gbm, newdata = valid))
```
The second model is another default GBM, but trained on 80% of the data (here, we combine the training and validation splits to get more training data), and cross-validated using 4 folds.
Note that cross-validation takes longer and is not usually done for really large datasets.

```{r}
## h2o.rbind makes a copy here, so it's better to use splitFrame with `ratios = c(0.8)` instead above
gbm <- h2o.gbm(x = predictors, y = response, training_frame = h2o.rbind(train, valid), nfolds = 4, seed = 0xDECAF)
## Show a detailed summary of the cross validation metrics
## This gives you an idea of the variance between the folds
gbm@model$cross_validation_metrics_summary
```


```{r}
## Get the cross-validated AUC by scoring the combined holdout predictions.
## (Instead of taking the average of the metrics across the folds)
h2o.auc(h2o.performance(gbm, xval = TRUE))
```
We see that the cross-validated performance is similar to the validation set performance:

Next, we train a GBM with “I feel lucky” parameters.
We’ll use early stopping to automatically tune the number of trees using the validation AUC.
We’ll use a lower learning rate (lower is always better, just takes more trees to converge).
We’ll also use stochastic sampling of rows and columns to (hopefully) improve generalization.
```{r}
gbm <- h2o.gbm(
  ## standard model parameters
  x = predictors,
  y = response,
  training_frame = train,
  validation_frame = valid,
  ## more trees is better if the learning rate is small enough
  ## here, use "more than enough" trees - we have early stopping
  ntrees = 10000,
  ## smaller learning rate is better (this is a good value for most datasets, but see below for annealing)
  learn_rate=0.01,
  ## early stopping once the validation AUC doesn't improve by at least 0.01% for 5 consecutive scoring events
  stopping_rounds = 5, stopping_tolerance = 1e-4, stopping_metric = "AUC",
  ## sample 80% of rows per tree
  sample_rate = 0.8,
  ## sample 80% of columns per split
  col_sample_rate = 0.8,
  ## fix a random number generator seed for reproducibility
  seed = 1234,
  ## score every 10 trees to make early stopping reproducible (it depends on the scoring interval)
  score_tree_interval = 10
)
## Get the AUC on the validation set
h2o.auc(h2o.performance(gbm, valid = TRUE))
```
For this small dataset, dropping 20% of observations per tree seems too aggressive in terms of adding regularization. For larger datasets, this is usually not a bad idea. But we’ll let this parameter tune freshly below, so no worries.
Note: To see what other stopping_metric parameters you can specify, simply pass an invalid option:
"stopping_metric" must be in "AUTO", "deviance", "logloss", "MSE", "AUC","lift_top_group", "r2", "misclassification",

Hyper-Parameter Search
Next, we’ll do real hyper-parameter optimization to see if we can beat the best AUC so far (around 94%).
The key here is to start tuning some key parameters first (i.e., those that we expect to have the biggest impact on the results). From experience with gradient boosted trees across many datasets, we can state the following “rules”:

1. Build as many trees (ntrees) as it takes until the validation set error starts increasing.
2. A lower learning rate (learn_rate) is generally better, but will require more trees. Using learn_rate=0.02and learn_rate_annealing=0.995 (reduction of learning rate with each additional tree) can help speed up convergence without sacrificing accuracy too much, and is great to hyper-parameter searches. For faster scans, use values of 0.05 and 0.99 instead.
3. The optimum maximum allowed depth for the trees (max_depth) is data dependent, deeper trees take longer to train, especially at depths greater than 10.
4. Row and column sampling (sample_rate and col_sample_rate) can improve generalization and lead to lower validation and test set errors. Good general values for large datasets are around 0.7 to 0.8 (sampling 70-80 percent of the data) for both parameters. Column sampling per tree (col_sample_rate_per_tree) can also be tuned. Note that it is multiplicative with col_sample_rate, so setting both parameters to 0.8 results in 64% of columns being considered at any given node to split.
5. For highly imbalanced classification datasets (e.g., fewer buyers than non-buyers), stratified row sampling based on response class membership can help improve predictive accuracy. It is configured with sample_rate_per_class (array of ratios, one per response class in lexicographic order).
6. Most other options only have a small impact on the model performance, but are worth tuning with a Random hyper-parameter search nonetheless, if highest performance is critical.

First we want to know what value of max_depth to use because it has a big impact on the model training time and optimal values depend strongly on the dataset.
We’ll do a quick Cartesian grid search to get a rough idea of good candidate max_depth values. Each model in the grid search will use early stopping to tune the number of trees using the validation set AUC, as before.
We’ll use learning rate annealing to speed up convergence without sacrificing too much accuracy.
```{r}
## Depth 10 is usually plenty of depth for most datasets, but you never know
hyper_params = list( max_depth = seq(1,29,2) )
#hyper_params = list( max_depth = c(4,6,8,12,16,20) ) ##faster for larger datasets
grid <- h2o.grid(
  ## hyper parameters
  hyper_params = hyper_params,
  ## full Cartesian hyper-parameter search
  search_criteria = list(strategy = "Cartesian"),
  ## which algorithm to run
  algorithm="gbm",
  ## identifier for the grid, to later retrieve it
  grid_id="depth_grid",
  ## standard model parameters
  x = predictors,
  y = response,
  training_frame = train,
  validation_frame = valid,
  ## more trees is better if the learning rate is small enough
  ## here, use "more than enough" trees - we have early stopping
  ntrees = 10000,
  ## smaller learning rate is better
  ## since we have learning_rate_annealing, we can afford to start with a bigger learning rate
  learn_rate = 0.05,
  ## learning rate annealing: learning_rate shrinks by 1% after every tree
  ## (use 1.00 to disable, but then lower the learning_rate)
  learn_rate_annealing = 0.99,
  ## sample 80% of rows per tree
  sample_rate = 0.8,
  ## sample 80% of columns per split
  col_sample_rate = 0.8,
  ## fix a random number generator seed for reproducibility
  seed = 1234,
  ## early stopping once the validation AUC doesn't improve by at least 0.01% for 5 consecutive scoring events
  stopping_rounds = 5,
  stopping_tolerance = 1e-4,
  stopping_metric = "AUC",
  ## score every 10 trees to make early stopping reproducible (it depends on the scoring interval)
  score_tree_interval = 10
)
## by default, display the grid search results sorted by increasing logloss (since this is a classification task)
grid
## sort the grid models by decreasing AUC
sortedGrid <- h2o.getGrid("depth_grid", sort_by="auc", decreasing = TRUE)
sortedGrid
## find the range of max_depth for the top 5 models
topDepths = sortedGrid@summary_table$max_depth[1:5]
minDepth = min(as.numeric(topDepths))
maxDepth = max(as.numeric(topDepths))
```
Now that we know a good range for max_depth, we can tune all other parameters in more detail. Since we don’t know what combinations of hyper-parameters will result in the best model, we’ll use random hyper-parameter search to “let the machine get luckier than a best guess of any human”.
```{r}
hyper_params = list(
  ## restrict the search to the range of max_depth established above

)

)
## Sort the grid models by AUC
sortedGrid <- h2o.getGrid("final_grid", sort_by = "auc", decreasing = TRUE)
sortedGrid
```

We can inspect the best 5 models from the grid search explicitly, and query their validation AUC:
```{r}
for (i in 1:5) {
  gbm <- h2o.getModel(sortedGrid@model_ids[[i]])
  print(h2o.auc(h2o.performance(gbm, valid = TRUE)))
}
```

Model Inspection and Final Test Set Scoring
Let’s see how well the best model of the grid search (as judged by validation set AUC) does on the held out test set:
```{r}
gbm <- h2o.getModel(sortedGrid@model_ids[[1]])
print(h2o.auc(h2o.performance(gbm, newdata = test)))

```
Good news. It does as well on the test set as on the validation set, so it looks like our best GBM model generalizes well to the unseen test set:


We can inspect the winning model’s parameters:
```{r}
gbm@parameters
```
Now we can confirm that these parameters are generally sound, by building a GBM model on the whole dataset (instead of the 60%) and using internal 5-fold cross-validation (re-using all other parameters including the seed):

```{r}
model <- do.call(h2o.gbm,
        ## update parameters in place
        {
          p <- gbm@parameters
          p$model_id = NULL          ## do not overwrite the original grid model
          p$training_frame = df      ## use the full dataset
          p$validation_frame = NULL  ## no validation frame
          p$nfolds = 5               ## cross-validation
          p
        }
)
model@model$cross_validation_metrics_summary
```
Ouch! So it looks like we overfit quite a bit on the validation set as the mean AUC on the 5 folds is “only” 96.06% +/- 0.67%. So we cannot always expect AUCs of 97% with these parameters on this dataset. So to get a better estimate of model performance, the Random hyper-parameter search could have used nfolds = 5 (or 10, or similar) in combination with 80% of the data for training (i.e., not holding out a validation set, but only the final test set). However, this would take more time, as nfolds+1 models will be built for every set of parameters.
Instead, to save time, let’s just scan through the top 5 models and cross-validated their parameters with nfolds=5 on the entire dataset:

```{r}
for (i in 1:5) {
  gbm <- h2o.getModel(sortedGrid@model_ids[[i]])
  cvgbm <- do.call(h2o.gbm,
        ## update parameters in place
        {
          p <- gbm@parameters
          p$model_id = NULL          ## do not overwrite the original grid model
          p$training_frame = df      ## use the full dataset
          p$validation_frame = NULL  ## no validation frame
          p$nfolds = 5               ## cross-validation
          p
        }
  )
  print(gbm@model_id)
  print(cvgbm@model$cross_validation_metrics_summary[5,]) ## Pick out the "AUC" row
}
```
The avid reader might have noticed that we just implicitly did further parameter tuning using the “final” test set (which is part of the entire dataset df), which is not good practice – one is not supposed to use the “final” test set more than once. Hence, we’re not going to pick a different “best” model, but we’re just learning about the variance in AUCs. It turns out, for this tiny dataset, that the variance is rather large, which is not surprising.
Keeping the same “best” model, we can make test set predictions as follows:

```{r}
gbm <- h2o.getModel(sortedGrid@model_ids[[1]])
preds <- h2o.predict(gbm, test)
head(preds)
gbm@model$validation_metrics@metrics$max_criteria_and_metric_scores
```
Note that the label (survived or not) is predicted as well (in the first predict column), and it uses the threshold with the highest F1 score (here: 0.528098) to make labels from the probabilities for survival (p1). The probability for death (p0) is given for convenience, as it is just 1-p1.

The model and the predictions can be saved to file as follows:
```{r}
h2o.saveModel(gbm, "/tmp/bestModel.csv", force=TRUE)
h2o.exportFile(preds, "/tmp/bestPreds.csv", force=TRUE)
```
The model can also be exported as a plain old Java object (POJO) for H2O-independent (standalone/Storm/Kafka/UDF) scoring in any Java environment.
```{r}
h2o.download_pojo(gbm)
```
#Ensembling Techniques
After learning above that the variance of the test set AUC of the top few models was rather large, we might be able to turn this into our advantage by using ensembling techniques. The simplest one is taking the average of the predictions (survival probabilities) of the top k grid search model predictions (here, we use k=10):

```{r}
prob = NULL
k=10
for (i in 1:k) {
  gbm <- h2o.getModel(sortedGrid@model_ids[[i]])
  if (is.null(prob)) prob = h2o.predict(gbm, test)$p1
  else prob = prob + h2o.predict(gbm, test)$p1
}
prob <- prob/k
head(prob)
```
We can bring those ensemble predictions to our R session’s memory space and use other R packages.

```{r}
probInR  <- as.vector(prob)
labelInR <- as.vector(as.numeric(test[[response]]))
if (! ("cvAUC" %in% rownames(installed.packages()))) { install.packages("cvAUC") }
library(cvAUC)
cvAUC::AUC(probInR, labelInR)
```

This simple blended ensemble test set prediction has an even higher AUC than the best single model, but we need to do more validation studies, ideally using cross-validation. We leave this as an exercise for the reader – take the parameters of the top 10 models, retrain them with nfolds=5 on the full dataset, set keep_holdout_predictions=TRUE and average the predicted probabilities in h2o.getFrame(cvgbm[i]@model$cross_validation_holdout_predictions_frame_id), then score that with cvAUC as shown above).
For more sophisticated ensembling approaches, such as stacking via a superlearner, we refer to the H2O Ensemble github page.

#Summary
We learned how to build H2O GBM models for a binary classification task on a small but realistic dataset with numerical and categorical variables, with the goal to maximize the AUC (ranges from 0.5 to 1). We first established a baseline with the default model, then carefully tuned the remaining hyper-parameters without “too much” human guess-work. We used both Cartesian and Random hyper-parameter searches to find good models. We were able to get the AUC on a holdout test set from the low 94% range with the default model to the mid 97% after tuning, and to the high 97% with some simple ensembling technique known as blending. We performed simple cross-validation variance analysis to learn that results were slightly “lucky” due to the specific train/valid/test set splits, and settled to expect mid 96% AUCs instead.
Note that this script and the findings therein are directly transferrable to large datasets on distributed clusters including Spark/Hadoop environments.
